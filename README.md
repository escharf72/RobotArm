# Robot Arm
## Planning
### Project description:
The project is a claw machine that moves a claw in the x, y, and z planes with a joystick and allows the user to pick up pieces of candy at the bottom of the box.
### Components:
- Servos
- Laser-cut acrylic box
- Joystick (3D printed)
- Laser-cut gears
- 3D printed track for rack-and-pinion
- Wires!!
- Tough cloth for belt
### Little mechanisms:
- Photointerrupter to prevent damage

## Winding Mechanism:

## Belt:
The belt moves the claw left to right and will be connected to the rack and pinion that will move it front to back. The belt is an assembly made up of a belt on axles with a servo connected to one to drive the movement. Connected to the belt is the winding mechanism that rides on a piece of acrylic to keep it from pulling down to much. On the top is the connection to the rack and pinon to move front and back. This piece is 3D printed and holds a servo and gear. The belt is 3D printer belt and the axles are made to perfectly mesh using pitch. The connection from belt to winding mechanism is a 3D printed piece with bars coming up and to the side that slide along the walls to keep the winding mechanism straight.

## Claw Mechanism:
The claw mechanism is comprised of a base with a servo holder on it that controls the two parts of the claw, causing it to open and close. It will be hung from the winding mechanism, allowing it to go up and down for the z axis of the claw machine. 
The parts of the claw have a unique design that limits the density of material but is still structurally sound. Attached are scoops that will help to grasp the candy in the machine. They each have a hook so that I can put a rubber band between the two of them. The rubber band will act as a counter to the pull of the servo and strings to open the claw.

## Rack and Pinion:


### Robot Arm Project
## What we finished
In the time that we had in the lab, we were able to finish a claw, a belt, and a winding mechanism. The claw ws not connected, but was able to open and close upon the activation of the servo that sat on top of the base. The claw had strings that would allow it to hang from the winding mechanism and move up and down. The winding mechanism was a part we had used in our project last year that we scaled and adapted to fit this project. It consists of servos, gears, and an axle that turned , winding a string. Eve added custom laser cut and 3D printed parts on the top that allowed it to slide into a track on the bottom of the belt. As the belt, powered by servos with ridged axles, turned, it would bring the winding mechanism along within, thus providing the left-to-right motion in our claw machine.
## What could have been/hopefully will be
We did not have the chance to create the rack-and-pinion system that would have provided the y direction of motion for the claw, but Immie had begun working on the planning for that after finishing the belt We also did not get to finish the joystick, though Eve's design in Solidworks was mostly done when we had to leave. The last part of this project would have been all of the coding and wiring aspects to combine the many servos and sensors. Elisabeth had begun to brainstorm about the code and start compiling old codes into something that would be a helpful start to the code for the project.
