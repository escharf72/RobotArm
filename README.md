## Winding Mechanism:

## Belt:
The belt moves the claw left to right and will be connected to the rack and pinion that will move it front to back. The belt is an assembly made up of a belt on axles with a servo connected to one to drive the movement. Connected to the belt is the winding mechanism that rides on a piece of acrylic to keep it from pulling down to much. On the top is the connection to the rack and pinon to move front and back. This piece is 3D printed and holds a servo and gear. The belt is 3D printer belt and the axles are made to perfectly mesh using pitch. The connection from belt to winding mechanism is a 3D printed piece with bars coming up and to the side that slide along the walls to keep the winding mechanism straight.

## Claw Mechanism:
The claw mechanism is comprised of a base with a servo holder on it that controls the two parts of the claw, causing it to open and close. It will be hung from the winding mechanism, allowing it to go up and down for the z axis of the claw machine. The base is shelled to reduce material waste. It has holes for pegs to run through the width of the box, along with an attachment rung in the back that provides stability. On top it has holes into which the servo holder is drilled. The servo holder is a very unique-looking part that demonstrates the benefits of a 3D printer in creating unusual parts to specifically fit our task. It has a mount for the servo with a slit for the wheel that allows it to spin freely. The arm that reaches out in the front has a hole in it through which the strings are fed, providing a fulcrum for the string connecting the wheel-servo setup and the two sides of the claw. The servo only turns a few degrees, but it is enough to open the claw due to the bigger diameter of the winding wheel. (Mechanical advantage!) The 3D printed parts of the claw have a unique design that limits the density of material but is still structurally sound. Attached are scoops that will help to grasp the candy in the machine by providing more surface area with which to grab the candy. They each have a hook so that I can put a rubber band between the two of them. The rubber band will act as a counter to the pull of the servo and strings to open the claw. It is a very important component, because without it the claw would fly open at the slightest pull on the string and it would not be able to keep a firm grasp on the object once it had been picked up.

## Rack and Pinion:


### Robot Arm Project
## What we finished
In the time that we had in the lab, we were able to finish a claw, a belt, and a winding mechanism. The claw ws not connected, but was able to open and close upon the activation of the servo that sat on top of the base. The claw had strings that would allow it to hang from the winding mechanism and move up and down. The winding mechanism was a part we had used in our project last year and we scaled and adapted it to fit this project. It consists of servos, gears, and an axle that turns, winding a string. Eve added custom laser cut and 3D printed parts on the top that allowed it to slide into a track on the bottom of the belt. As the belt, powered by servos with ridged axles that matched the pitch of the ridged belt material, turned, it would bring the winding mechanism along within, thus providing the left-to-right motion in our claw machine.
## What could have been/hopefully will be
We did not have the chance to create the rack-and-pinion system that would have provided the y direction of motion for the claw, but Immie had begun working on the planning for that after finishing the belt. It would have consisted of a laser cut track with the same pitch as a gear attached to the belt frame that would allow the gear to travel along, bringing the belt mechanism, winder, and claw with it as it went. Another part of the rack-and-pinion design would include adding arms coming offf the ends of the box containing the belt that would rest in slits cut into the side of the bigger claw machine box. That way the gear would be able to be positioned in the track and the slits would bear the weight of the whole mechanism. We also did not get to finish the joystick, though Eve's design in Solidworks was mostly done when we had to leave. It is a complicated 3D printed part that causes the joystick part to move four potentiometers as it is rotated. The last part of this project would have been all of the coding and wiring aspects to combine the many servos and sensors. Elisabeth had begun to brainstorm about the code and start compiling old codes into something that would be a helpful start to the code for the project. She had been brainstorming how to read the values given by the potentiometers in Eve's joystick design and translate that into commands for movement in the x and y directions.
