# Robot Arm
## Planning
### Project description:
The project is a claw machine that moves a claw in the x, y, and z planes with a joystick and allows the user to pick up pieces of candy at the bottom of the box.
### Components:
- Servos
- Laser-cut acrylic box
- Joystick (3D printed)
- Laser-cut gears
- 3D printed track for rack-and-pinion
- Wires!!
- Tough cloth for belt
### Little mechanisms:
- Photointerrupter to prevent damage

## Winding Mechanism:

## Belt:
The belt moves the claw left to right and will be connected to the rack and pinion that will move it front to back. The belt is an assembly made up of a belt on axles with a servo connected to one to drive the movement. Connected to the belt is the winding mechanism that rides on a piece of acrylic to keep it from pulling down to much. On the top is the connection to the rack and pinon to move front and back. This piece is 3D printed and holds a servo and gear. The belt is 3D printer belt and the axles are made to perfectly mesh using pitch. The connection from belt to winding mechanism is a 3D printed piece with bars coming up and to the side that slide along the walls to keep the winding mechanism straight. 

## Claw Mechanism:
The claw mechanism is comprised of a base with a servo holder on it that controls the two parts of the claw, causing it to open and close. It will be hung from the winding mechanism, allowing it to go up and down for the z axis of the claw machine. 
The parts of the claw have a unique design that limits the density of material but is still structurally sound. Attached are scoops that will help to grasp the candy in the machine. They each have a hook so that I can put a rubber band between the two of them. The rubber band will act as a counter to the pull of the servo and strings to open the claw.
